### Hi there 👋

My name is Ivo and my goal is to help developers get better at what they do while learning stuff myself. I mostly work in Enterprise Software development in Java as a Tech Lead. I am Editor of the Duch Java Magazine, which is created in association with the [NLJug](https://nljug.org/) and I am a frequent writer myself. I am a public speaker on many IT related subjects. You can find my credentials [here](https://www.ivowoltring.org/), but you do have to know something about a terminal to get to it 😄. Make sure not to type `rm -rm /`, I said don't! 😏. 

I Love to code and everything associated with it. 🔭 I've worked on lots of docker related projects and have written a well recieved [Docker, FROM scratch](https://docker-from-scratch.ivonet.nl/) workshop about it (free!!, but a shoutout on twitter is appreciated!). If you are interested in Docker you should definetely check it out. One of my passions is clean code and the mindset needed to do that right.

I [blog](https://www.ivonet.nl/) often on IT related topics. I started doing this years ago for you and my future self. As I work on many diverse topics I sometimes forget that I already did a thing a few years back and now when I google on a topic I sometimes have the great pleasure to find an article of myself telling myself how to do that thing. Somethimes my blogs are rants on a thing that irritates me or keeps my head busy. Sometimes they are like notes on a topic I had trouble researching and don't want to research again. I hopy you enjoy them too.

🌱 I’m currently playing with:
* Reactjs
√ Kubernetes 
* CQRS
