### Hi there 👋

My name is **Ivo Woltring** and my goal is to help developers get better at what they do while learning stuff myself. I mostly work in Enterprise Software development in Java as a Tech Lead. I am an Editor of the Duch Java Magazine, which is created in association with the [NLJug](https://nljug.org/) and I am a frequent writer myself. I am a public speaker on many IT-related subjects. You can find out more about me on my website [ivowoltring.org](https://www.ivowoltring.org#whoami), but you do have to know something about a terminal to get to it 😄. Make sure not to type [rm -rf /](https://www.ivowoltring.org#rm%20-rf%20/), I said don't! 😏. 

I Love to code and everything associated with it. 🔭 I've worked on lots of docker related projects and have written a well-received [Docker, FROM scratch](https://docker-from-scratch.ivonet.nl/) workshop about it (free!!, but a shoutout on `X` is appreciated!). If you are interested in Docker you should check it out. One of my passions is clean code and the mindset needed to do that right.

Sometimes I have the privilege to speak at [conferences](https://www.ivowoltring.org#talks) and [meetups](https://www.ivowoltring.org#meetups) or give guest [lectures](https://www.ivowoltring.org#edu) at Dutch Universities. It is something I love to do when I have a topic I am passionate about.

I blog [IvoNet.nl](https://www.ivonet.nl/) often on IT-related topics. I started doing this years ago for you and my future self. As I work on many diverse topics I sometimes forget that I already did a thing a few years back and now when I google on a topic I sometimes have the great pleasure of finding an article of myself telling myself how to do that thing. Sometimes my blogs are rants on a thing that irritates me or keeps my head busy. Sometimes they are like notes on a topic I had trouble researching and don't want to research again. I hope you enjoy them.

I love contributing to OpenSource projects. Most recently to the [Jakarta EE starter project](https://start.jakarta.ee/).
