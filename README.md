### Hi there 👋

My name is Ivo and my goal is to help developers get better at what they do while learning stuff myself. I am Editor of the Duch Java Magazine created in association with the [NLJug](https://nljug.org/) and am a frequent writer myself. I am a public speaker on many IT related subjects. You can find my credentials [here](https://www.ivowoltring.org/), but you do have to know something about a terminal to get to it 😄. Make sure not to type `rm -rm /`, I said don't! 😏. 

One can say I'm a CodeSmith. I Love to code and everything associated with it. 🔭 I’m currently working on lots of docker related projects and have written a well recieved [Docker, FROM scratch](https://docker-from-scratch.ivonet.nl/) workshop about it (free, but a like is appreciated!). If you are interested in Docker you should definetely check it out. 

🌱 I’m currently interested in learning more about:
* Reactjs
√ Kubernetes 
* CQRS
